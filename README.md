## Jave_design-Patterns
 In software development, a pattern (or design pattern) is a written document that describes a general solution to a design problem that recurs repeatedly in many projects. Software designers adapt the pattern solution to their specific project.
 
# I design multiple of design Pattern projects which are: 

# ATM using State Pttern
This is used by just using the state pattern.
The state pattern is a behavioral software design pattern that allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. This pattern is close to the concept of finite-state machines.

# Building Robot - Builder Pattern
This is used by using the builder pattern. it shows us building robot parts. 
The builder pattern is a design pattern designed to provide a flexible solution to various object creation problems in object-oriented programming. The intent of the Builder design pattern is to separate the construction of a complex object from its representation

# Enemy Ship - Factory Pattern
This is used by using the builder pattern. it shows us making a enemy ship attacking the ship.
The factory method pattern is a creational pattern that uses factory methods to deal with the problem of creating objects without having to specify the exact class of the object that will be created.

# Proxy Internet connection - proxy Pattern
This is used by using Proxy Pattern. its shows a internet connecting.
In proxy pattern, a class represents functionality of another class. This type of design pattern comes under structural pattern. In proxy pattern, we create object having original object to interface its functionality to outer world.

# Scrabble Game - Singleton Pattern
This is used by using Singleton Pattern. Its a game of scrabble made by a singleton pattern.
Singleton pattern is used for logging, drivers objects, caching and thread pool. Singleton design pattern is also used in other design patterns like Abstract Factory, Builder, Prototype, Facade etc. Singleton design pattern is used in core java classes also, for example java.

# Telvision - Command Pattern
This is used by using Command Pattern. Shows what the person needs for watching the telvision.
The command pattern is a behavioral design pattern in which an object is used to encapsulate all information needed to perform an action or trigger an event at a later time. This information includes the method name, the object that owns the method and values for the method parameters.

## Reference 
good reference to study more on design patterns I would highly recoomend the book head first design patterns
